Physical implementation (Oracle)
-----------------------
For ALL objects we will have a prefix of "VI".
For each object, use a prefix as below - 

Sequence - SQ
Sequence name to should be same as the name of the column that this sequence is used to populate.

Before Statement trigger - BS
After Statement trigger AS

Before EACH ROW Trigger - BR
After EACH row trigger - AR

Tables - 
For any maint tables - use the suffix _M
For any mapping tables (Relation tables) use the suffix _P (to indicate map)
For any look up tables use the suffix _R (Reference)
For any log tables use the suffix _L (to indicate log)

This will help to separate any other application objects present in the same database.


1. Create a tablespace VI_DATA_TS
Data file: VI_DATA_DF01 (c:\oracle\vis_data_df01)

2. Create a schema (User VI_OWNR)
This schema (user) will own all the objects (tables, sequences, procedures, functions and all other objects) that we are going to create.
Make sure to assign the "DEFAULT TABLESPACE" for this user VI_OWNR.

Create all the below objects in that schema VI_OWNR.

Table: vi_compny_m (Company Master)
--------------------------------
compny_legl_Nm     VARCHAR2(32) NOT NULL
compny_desc        VARCHAR2(1024) NOT NULL
compny_start_dtm   DATE NOT NULL
compny_email_addr  VARCHAR2(64) NOT NULL

Define primary key on compny_legl_nm
All columns to be defined as not null

In this table, there will ONLY be one record for the entire company.
Since, this will only have one record, we can insert the record ahead of the time if we know the data.
So, once the record is inserted, we can create a trigger not to allow any inserts, updates, deletes.

Trigger - vi_compny_bs
- Allow no inserts, no updates, no deletes.

If we ever need to update the compny_email_addr or company_desc, then we have to disable the trigger, and make modifications and re-enable it.
This is a manual process, there will be no screen developed for this.


vi_dept_m
dept_id   NUMBER(1) NOT NULL
dept_nm   VARCHAR2(32) NOT NULL
dept_mgr_emp_id NUMBER(2) NOT NULL (this not null constraint may have to incorporated later)

Define dept_id as the primary key.
Define dept_nm as the unique key.

By keeping the head_emp_id, we are restricting that there can ONLY be one manager to each department.
Since by now, we did not create the vi_emp_m table, it is not possible to establish a relation between this table, and the vi_emp_m table.



vi_emp_m
emp_id NUMBER(2) NOT NULL -- This column is generated using a sequence "vi_emp_id_sq"
emp_nm VARCHAR2(32) NOT NULL
emp_addr VARCHAR2(128) NOT NULL -- currently we are not storing each line of the address, and city etc separately. That will be done in phase 2
emp_join_dt DATE NOT NULL -- this field is used to store only the DATE part (no time part)
hrly_pmt_amt NUMBER(5,2) NOT NULL -- We assume the employees paid by hour, so hourly pmt_amt, Also, we need to ensure, each employee salary is not visible to others.
dept_id NUMBER(1) NOT NULL -- this references to the vi_dept_m table dept_id column.
